Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 2025
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 3979 (business_id ) 537 (user_id )
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT * 
	
FROM user 
WHERE 1 IS NULL  

			or 2 is NULL 
			
or 3 is NULL 

			or 4 is NULL 
			
or 5 is NULL 
			
or 6 is NULL 
			
or 7 is NULL 
			
or 8 is NULL 
			
or 9 is NULL 
			
or 10 is NULL 

			or 11 is NULL 

			or 12 is NULL 
			
or 13 is NULL 

			or 14 is NULL 
			
or 15 is NULL 
			
or 16 is NULL 
			
or 17 is NULL 

			or 18 is NULL 

			or 19 is NULL 

			or 20 is NULL;



	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1.0		max: 5.0		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144

From the above result, it is seen that although users with most fans posed many reviews, more reviews do not
necessarily bring more fans. 
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: 
+------------+------------+
| love_count | hate_count |
+------------+------------+
|       1780 |        232 |
+------------+------------+
	
There are more reviews with the word "love".
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select 
(select count(text)
from review
where text like '%love%') as love_count,
(select count(text)
from review
where text like '%hate%') as hate_count
;
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

From the top 10 users with most fans, it does not seem to have a strong relationship between the number of fans
and being listed as useful or funny.
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

   Yes, they have different distribution of hours. 

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

    Yes, they have a different number of reviews.          
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
+---------------+-------+-------------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+------------------------+
| name          | stars | category    | hours                | review_count | postal_code | neighborhood           |
+---------------+-------+-------------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+------------------------+
| 99 Cent Sushi |   2.0 | Restaurants | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |            5 | M5B 2E5     | Downtown Core          |
| Pizzaiolo     |   3.0 | Restaurants | Saturday|10:00-4:00  |           34 | M5H 1X6     | Entertainment District |
| Edulis        |   4.0 | Restaurants | Saturday|18:00-23:00 |           89 | M5V         | Niagara                |
| Sushi Osaka   |   4.5 | Restaurants | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |            8 | M9A 1C2     | Etobicoke              |
+---------------+-------+-------------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+------------------------+
    
    No, locations of these two group do not seem to have a certain relation with star ratings. Hours are more likely determined by 
    owners of the business arbitrarily. 

SQL code used for analysis:

    select name, stars, category, hours, review_count, postal_code, neighborhood

    from business inner join category on business.id=category.business_id inner join hours on business.id=hours.business_id

    where city='Toronto' and category='Restaurants'

    group by stars;


		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
   Business that is open has more average review. This makes sense because a closed businees is not likely 
   to receive reviews any more.        
         
ii. Difference 2:
   Business that is open has a better star rating. This also makes sense because customers love good service and will give higher rating,
   which helps the business keep running.     
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
    select is_open, avg(business.stars), avg(review_count)

    from business
group by is_open;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   
   I would like to analyze the relationship between business' star rating and its total number of reviews.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
   
    In order to understand the relationship between business' star rating and its total number of reviews, we will need names of business,
    review_count, and their overall star rating.
                               
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+----------------------------------------+------------+----------------+
